spreadsheet - rows of seemingly-random numbers
//the spreadsheet is an array.
//each row is an array within that array. For each row array you need to

FOR EACH ARRAY - run findDifference function
using the for...in
   calculate the spreadsheet's checksum + return this value
   for each array within the array you'll get a value returned. You must now add all the values.

4. For each row, determine the difference between the largest value and the smallest value;
   the checksum is the sum of all of these differences.

Create a function to find the checksum of the following.

var data = [
[409, 194, 207, 470, 178],
[454, 235, 333, 511, 103],
[474, 293, 525, 372, 408],
[428, 4321, 2786, 6683, 3921],
[265, 262, 6206, 2207, 5712]
]

```

```
